    <h2>Portfolio</h2>
    <p>
      Hi, I’m Chloe Ann Erhardt! Welcome to my creative corner of the web! This portfolio is more than just a collection of work; it’s a journey through my passion for Photography, Digital Graphics, and UX Design. Each project tells a story — blending visuals and user experience to create meaningful, memorable moments.
From capturing fleeting emotions through my lens to crafting intuitive digital experiences, I thrive on turning ideas into engaging realities. Whether it’s a bold graphic, a seamless app flow, or a stunning photo, my goal is to connect, inspire, and solve problems with creativity and precision.

Dive in and explore how I blend art and technology to bring concepts to life. Let’s make something extraordinary together.
